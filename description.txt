The Missing Link - Summoner mod aims to fix two stages of progression for the summoner class:
1. Starting point - all summoner weapons require you to first be able to kill for resources, not anymore!
2. Post-Plantera - Spooky Armor is the only crafted yellow rarity armor except Turtle that doesn't have a variant, but Turtle is Melee that also have Bettle armor.

Item's added:

Pre-Underground Ice:
Sapphire Watcher Staff - an early game summon equivalent/weaker Finch Staff, crafted with Tin/Copper, Sapphires and Lenses.
Silky Whip - a No killing required whip, slightly weaker than the Leather Whip, crafted with Iron/Lead, Silk and Wood.
after getting those you can easily scale the depths of underground ice to continue progression like any other class.

Post-Plantera:
Spooky Crown - a healmet varian to th spooky armor, sacrificing quite a bit of damage for sentry slots and Minion Lifesteal.
Tamer's Gauntlet - a combination accessory for the Power Glove to give it a summoner variant that apply the size boost to whips.
those should give you enough choice to change your playstyle around the moonlord fight and other post-Plantera content

Post-Moonlord:
The Ulta Whip - a Meme Whip that is designed to be broken AF while still maintaining the vanilla feel.
the echo damage is similar to the firecracker's effect but is single target and is WAY bigger.
